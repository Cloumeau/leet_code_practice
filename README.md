# LeetCode Practice

A collection of LeetCode solutions organized by data structure and algorithm topics.

## Directory Structure

- **Array_String** - Array and string manipulation problems
- **Binary_Tree** - Binary tree traversal and problems
- **Hashmap** - Hash map/dictionary based problems
- **Intervals** - Interval-based problems
- **LinkedList** - Linked list operations and problems
- **Two_Pointers** - Two pointer technique problems
- **stack** - Stack-based problems

## Usage

Each directory contains Python solution files for problems in that category. Solutions are organized by problem type and include implementations of various approaches.

## Getting Started

1. Navigate to the topic directory you want to practice
2. Review the solution files
3. Understand the approach and complexity analysis
4. Practice implementing solutions from scratch

## Topics Covered

- Data structures: Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists, Trees, Stacks, Hash Maps
- Algorithms: Two pointers, tree traversal, interval merging, and more
- Techniques: Dynamic programming, greedy, divide and conquer
